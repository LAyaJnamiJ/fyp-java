# fyp-java
A two-part Java program used to calculate the Thue-Morse autocorrelation coefficients (TMcor.java) and then assign colors to the resepctive values stored in a .csv file (TMart.java). 

Originally written by Dr. Darren Ong Chung Lee of Xiamen University Malaysia, and edited by Loh Jia Jun, a student of Xiamen University Malaysia, for the purpose of using it in their final year project.
## Changes made
Not much has been changed by the student apart from an additional block of code used to fetch values from [an API made by the student](https://github.com/LAyaJnamiJ/fyp-api), but it did not fulfill its ultimate goal so it's as good as not existing in the first place. 

Highlighting in given in the code as comments as to which parts of the code is whose.
## Using this project
There is no official release; just download the two files ([TMcor.java](/TMcor.java) and [TMart.java](/TMart.java)) and run them in an IDE of your choice that supports Java. 

To use the API-related functionalities, a dependency on the [JSON-Java package](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java) is required.
